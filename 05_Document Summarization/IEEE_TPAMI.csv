"Blomstedt P., Tang J., Xiong J., Granlund C., Corander J.",A bayesian predictive model for clustering data of mixed discrete and continuous type,2015,IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence,37,3,489,498,"Advantages of model-based clustering methods over heuristic alternatives have been widely demonstrated in the literature. Most model-based clustering algorithms assume that the data are either discrete or continuous, possibly allowing both types to be present in separate features. In this paper, we introduce a model-based approach for clustering feature vectors of mixed type, allowing each feature to simultaneously take on both categorical and real values. Such data may be encountered, for instance, in chemical and biological analyses, in the analysis of survey data, as well as in image analysis. Our model is formulated within a Bayesian predictive framework, where clustering solutions correspond to random partitions of the data. Using conjugate analysis, the posterior probability for each possible partition can be determined analytically, enabling the utilization of efficient computational search strategies for finding the posterior optimal partition. The derived model is illustrated using several synthetic and real datasets.",Bayes methods; mixed distributions; predictive models; unsupervised learning
"Henriques J.F., Caseiro R., Martins P., Batista J.",High-speed tracking with kernelized correlation filters,2015,IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence,37,3,583,596,"The core component of most modern trackers is a discriminative classifier, tasked with distinguishing between the target and the surrounding environment. To cope with natural image changes, this classifier is typically trained with translated and scaled sample patches. Such sets of samples are riddled with redundancies - any overlapping pixels are constrained to be the same. Based on this simple observation, we propose an analytic model for datasets of thousands of translated patches. By showing that the resulting data matrix is circulant, we can diagonalize it with the discrete Fourier transform, reducing both storage and computation by several orders of magnitude. Interestingly, for linear regression our formulation is equivalent to a correlation filter, used by some of the fastest competitive trackers. For kernel regression, however, we derive a new kernelized correlation filter (KCF), that unlike other kernel algorithms has the exact same complexity as its linear counterpart. Building on it, we also propose a fast multi-channel extension of linear correlation filters, via a linear kernel, which we call dual correlation filter (DCF). Both KCF and DCF outperform top-ranking trackers such as Struck or TLD on a 50 videos benchmark, despite running at hundreds of frames-per-second, and being implemented in a few lines of code (Algorithm 1). To encourage further developments, our tracking framework was made open-source.",circulant matrices; correlation filters; discrete Fourier transform; kernel methods; ridge regression; Visual tracking
"Delgado-Friedrichs O., Robins V., Sheppard A.",Skeletonization and partitioning of digital images using discrete morse theory,2015,IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence,37,3,654,666,"We show how discrete Morse theory provides a rigorous and unifying foundation for defining skeletons and partitions of grayscale digital images. We model a grayscale image as a cubical complex with a real-valued function defined on its vertices (the voxel values). This function is extended to a discrete gradient vector field using the algorithm presented in Robins, Wood, Sheppard TPAMI 33:1646 (2011). In the current paper we define basins (the building blocks of a partition) and segments of the skeleton using the stable and unstable sets associated with critical cells. The natural connection between Morse theory and homology allows us to prove the topological validity of these constructions; for example, that the skeleton is homotopic to the initial object. We simplify the basins and skeletons via Morse-theoretic cancellation of critical cells in the discrete gradient vector field using a strategy informed by persistent homology. Simple working Python code for our algorithms for efficient vector field traversal is included. Example data are taken from micro-CT images of porous materials, an application area where accurate topological models of pore connectivity are vital for fluid-flow modelling.",Curve skeleton; discrete Morse theory; medial axis transform; persistent homology; surface skeleton; watershed transform
Kong A.W.K.,A statistical analysis of iriscode and its security implications,2015,IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence,37,3,513,528,"IrisCode has been used to gather iris data for 430 million people. Because of the huge impact of IrisCode, it is vital that it is completely understood. This paper first studies the relationship between bit probabilities and a mean of iris images (The mean of iris images is defined as the average of independent iris images.) and then uses the Chi-square statistic, the correlation coefficient and a resampling algorithm to detect statistical dependence between bits. The results show that the statistical dependence forms a graph with a sparse and structural adjacency matrix. A comparison of this graph with a graph whose edges are defined by the inner product of the Gabor filters that produce IrisCodes shows that partial statistical dependence is induced by the filters and propagates through the graph. Using this statistical information, the security risk associated with two patented template protection schemes that have been deployed in commercial systems for producing application-specific IrisCodes is analyzed. To retain high identification speed, they use the same key to lock all IrisCodes in a database. The belief has been that if the key is not compromised, the IrisCodes are secure. This study shows that even without the key, application-specific IrisCodes can be unlocked and that the key can be obtained through the statistical dependence detected.",Biometrics; Daugman algorithm; iris recognition; statistical dependence; template protection
"Zhu Y., Lucey S.",Convolutional sparse coding for trajectory reconstruction,2015,IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence,37,3,529,540,"Trajectory basis Non-Rigid Structure from Motion (NRSfM) refers to the process of reconstructing the 3D trajectory of each point of a non-rigid object from just their 2D projected trajectories. Reconstruction relies on two factors: (i) the condition of the composed camera &amp; trajectory basis matrix, and (ii) whether the trajectory basis has enough degrees of freedom to model the 3D point trajectory. These two factors are inherently conflicting. Employing a trajectory basis with small capacity has the positive characteristic of reducing the likelihood of an ill-conditioned system (when composed with the camera) during reconstruction. However, this has the negative characteristic of increasing the likelihood that the basis will not be able to fully model the object's ""true"" 3D point trajectories. In this paper we draw upon a well known result centering around the Reduced Isometry Property (RIP) condition for sparse signal reconstruction. RIP allow us to relax the requirement that the full trajectory basis composed with the camera matrix must be well conditioned. Further, we propose a strategy for learning an over-complete basis using convolutional sparse coding from naturally occurring point trajectory corpora to increase the likelihood that the RIP condition holds for a broad class of point trajectories and camera motions. Finally, we propose an งค1 inspired objective for trajectory reconstruction that is able to ""adaptively"" select the smallest sub-matrix from an over-complete trajectory basis that balances (i) and (ii). We present more practical 3D reconstruction results compared to current state of the art in trajectory basis NRSfM.",convolutional sparse coding; Nonrigid structure from motion; reconstructability; งค0 norm; งค1 norm
"Trzcinski T., Christoudias M., Lepetit V.",Learning image descriptors with boosting,2015,IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence,37,3,597,610,"We propose a novel and general framework to learn compact but highly discriminative floating-point and binary local feature descriptors. By leveraging the boosting-trick we first show how to efficiently train a compact floating-point descriptor that is very robust to illumination and viewpoint changes. We then present the main contribution of this paper - a binary extension of the framework that demonstrates the real advantage of our approach and allows us to compress the descriptor even further. Each bit of the resulting binary descriptor, which we call BinBoost, is computed with a boosted binary hash function, and we show how to efficiently optimize the hash functions so that they are complementary, which is key to compactness and robustness. As we do not put any constraints on the weak learner configuration underlying each hash function, our general framework allows us to optimize the sampling patterns of recently proposed hand-crafted descriptors and significantly improve their performance. Moreover, our boosting scheme can easily adapt to new applications and generalize to other types of image data, such as faces, while providing state-of-the-art results at a fraction of the matching time and memory footprint.",binary embedding; boosting; Learning feature descriptors

In this paper, we cast the CSP algorithm in a probabilistic modeling setting. Specifically, probabilistic CSP (P-CSP) is proposed as a generic EEG spatio-temporal modeling framework that subsumes the CSP and regularized CSP algorithms. The proposed framework enables us to resolve the overfitting issue of CSP in a principled manner. We derive statistical inference algorithms that can alleviate the issue of local optima. In particular, an efficient algorithm based on eigendecomposition is developed for maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation in the case of isotropic noise. For more general cases, a variational algorithm is developed for group-wise sparse Bayesian learning for the P-CSP model and for automatically determining the model size. The two proposed algorithms are validated on a simulated data set. Their practical efficacy is also demonstrated by successful applications to single-trial classifications of three motor imagery EEG data sets and by the spatio-temporal pattern analysis of one EEG data set recorded in a Stroop color naming task.",Brain-computer interface; Common spatial patterns; Electroencephalogram; Fukunaga-Koontz transform; Sparse bayesian learning; Variational bayes
"Si X., Feng J., Zhou J., Luo Y.",Detection and rectification of distorted fingerprints,2015,IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence,37,3,555,568,"Elastic distortion of fingerprints is one of the major causes for false non-match. While this problem affects all fingerprintrecognition applications, it is especially dangerous in negative recognition applications, such as watchlist and deduplicationapplications. In such applications, malicious users may purposely distort their fingerprints to evade identification. In this paper, weproposed novel algorithms to detect and rectify skin distortion based on a single fingerprint image. Distortion detection is viewed as a two-class classification problem, for which the registered ridge orientation map and period map of a fingerprint are used as the feature vector and a SVM classifier is trained to perform the classification task. Distortion rectification (or equivalently distortion field estimation) is viewed as a regression problem, where the input is a distorted fingerprint and the output is the distortion field. To solve this problem, a database (called reference database) of various distorted reference fingerprints and corresponding distortion fields is built in the offline stage, and then in the online stage, the nearest neighbor of the input fingerprint is found in the reference database and the corresponding distortion field is used to transform the input fingerprint into a normal one. Promising results have been obtained on three databases containing many distorted fingerprints, namely FVC2004 DB1, Tsinghua Distorted Fingerprint database, and the NIST SD27 latent fingerprint database.",distortion; Fingerprint; nearest neighbor regression; PCA; registration

We introduce a regional contrast based salient object detection algorithm, which simultaneously evaluates global contrast differences and spatial weighted coherence scores. The proposed algorithm is simple, efficient, naturally multi-scale, and produces full-resolution, high-quality saliency maps. These saliency maps are further used to initialize a novel iterative version of GrabCut, namely SaliencyCut, for high quality unsupervised salient object segmentation. We extensively evaluated our algorithm using traditional salient object detection datasets, as well as a more challenging Internet image dataset. Our experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm consistently outperforms 15 existing salient object detection and segmentation methods, yielding higher precision and better recall rates. We also show that our algorithm can be used to efficiently extract salient object masks from Internet images, enabling effective sketch-based image retrieval (SBIR) via simple shape comparisons. Despite such noisy internet images, where the saliency regions are ambiguous, our saliency guided image retrieval achieves a superior retrieval rate compared with state-of-the-art SBIR methods, and additionally provides important target object region information.",image retrieval; saliency map; Salient object detection; unsupervised segmentation; visual attention
"Lezama J., Morel J.-M., Randall G., Grompone Von Gioi R.",A contrario 2D point alignment detection,2015,IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence,37,3,499,512,"In spite of many interesting attempts, the problem of automatically finding alignments in a 2D set of points seems to be still open. The difficulty of the problem is illustrated here by very simple examples. We then propose an elaborate solution. We show that a correct alignment detection depends on not less than four interlaced criteria, namely the amount of masking in texture, the relative bilateral local density of the alignment, its internal regularity, and finally a redundancy reduction step. Extending tools of the a contrario detection theory, we show that all of these detection criteria can be naturally embedded in a single probabilistic a contrario model with a single user parameter, the number of false alarms. Our contribution to the a contrario theory is the use of sophisticated conditional events on random point sets, for which expectation we nevertheless find easy bounds. By these bounds the mathematical consistency of our detection model receives a simple proof. Our final algorithm also includes a new formulation of the exclusion principle in Gestalt theory to avoid redundant detections. Aiming at reproducibility, a source code and an online demo open to any data point set are provided. The method is carefully compared to three state-of-the-art algorithms and an application to real data is discussed. Limitations of the final method are also illustrated and explained.",A contrario methods; Clustering; Point alignment detection; Poisson point process

Despite new advancements in the 3D imaging technologies, widely accepted representation of 3D fingerprint features and matching methodology is yet to emerge. This paper investigates 3D representation of widely employed 2D minutiae features by recovering and incorporating (i) minutiae height z and (ii) its 3D orientation ฅ๕ information and illustrates an effective matching strategy for matching popular minutiae features extended in 3D space. One of the obstacles of the emerging 3D fingerprint identification systems to replace the conventional 2D fingerprint system lies in their bulk and high cost, which is mainly contributed from the usage of structured lighting system or multiple cameras. This paper attempts to addresses such key limitations of the current 3D fingerprint technologies bydeveloping the single camera-based 3D fingerprint identification system. We develop a generalized 3D minutiae matching model and recover extended 3D fingerprint features from the reconstructed 3D fingerprints. 2D fingerprint images acquired for the 3D fingerprint reconstruction can themselves be employed for the performance improvement and have been illustrated in the work detailed in this paper. This paper also attempts to answer one of the most fundamental questions on the availability of inherent discriminableinformation from 3D fingerprints. The experimental results are presented on a database of 240 clients 3D fingerprints, which is made publicly available to further research efforts in this area, and illustrate the discriminant power of 3D minutiae representation andmatching to achieve performance improvement.",3d fingerprint individuality; 3d fingerprint matching; 3d minutiae; Biometrics; contactless fingerprint identification; photometric stereo
"Park C., Woehl T.J., Evans J.E., Browning N.D.",Minimum cost multi-way data association for optimizing multitarget tracking of interacting objects,2015,IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence,37,3,611,624,"This paper presents a general formulation for a minimum cost data association problem which associates data features via one-to-one, m-to-one and one-to-n links with minimum total cost of the links. A motivating example is a problem of tracking multiple interacting nanoparticles imaged on video frames, where particles can aggregate into one particle or a particle can be split into multiple particles. Many existing multitarget tracking methods are capable of tracking non-interacting targets or tracking interacting targets of restricted degrees of interactions. The proposed formulation solves a multitarget tracking problem for general degrees of inter-object interactions. The formulation is in the form of a binary integer programming problem. We propose a polynomial time solution approach that can obtain a good relaxation solution of the binary integer programming, so the approach can be applied for multitarget tracking problems of a moderate size (for hundreds of targets over tens of time frames). The resulting solution is always integral and obtains a better duality gap than the simple linear relaxation solution of the corresponding problem. The proposed method was validated through applications to simulated multitarget tracking problems and a real multitarget tracking problem.",binary integer programming; Data association; decomposition; lagrange dual relaxation

Unlike earlier methods, ours does not rely on local appearance similarity nor does require a good initial alignment. Furthermore, it can cope with non-linear deformations, topological differences, and partial graphs. To handle arbitrary non-linear deformations, we use Gaussian process regressions to represent the geometrical mapping relating the two graphs. In the absence of appearance information, we iteratively establish correspondences between points, update the mapping accordingly, and use it to estimate where to find the most likely correspondences that will be used in the next step. To make the computation tractable for large graphs, the set of new potential matches considered at each iteration is not selected at random as with many RANSAC-based algorithms. Instead, we introduce a so-called Active Testing Search strategy that performs a priority search to favor the most likely matches and speed-up the process. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach first on synthetic cases and then on angiography data, retinal fundus images, and microscopy image stacks acquired at very different resolutions.",active testing search; Graph matching; non-rigid registration
"Ferrer M.A., Diaz-Cabrera M., Morales A.",Static signature synthesis: A neuromotor inspired approach for biometrics,2015,IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence,37,3,667,680,"In this paper we propose a new method for generating synthetic handwritten signature images for biometric applications. The procedures we introduce imitate the mechanism of motor equivalence which divides human handwriting into two steps: the working out of an effector independent action plan and its execution via the corresponding neuromuscular path. The action plan is represented as a trajectory on a spatial grid. This contains both the signature text and its flourish, if there is one. The neuromuscular path is simulated by applying a kinematic Kaiser filter to the trajectory plan. The length of the filter depends on the pen speed which is generated using a scalar version of the sigma lognormal model. An ink deposition model, applied pixel by pixel to the pen trajectory, provides realistic static signature images. The lexical and morphological properties of the synthesized signatures as well as the range of the synthesis parameters have been estimated from real databases of real signatures such as the MCYT Off-line and the GPDS960GraySignature corpuses. The performance experiments show that by tuning only four parameters it is possible to generate synthetic identities with different stability and forgers with different skills. Therefore it is possible to create datasets of synthetic signatures with a performance similar to databases of real signatures. Moreover, we can customize the created dataset to produce skilled forgeries or simple forgeries which are easier to detect, depending on what the researcher needs. Perceptual evaluation gives an average confusion of 44.06 percent between real and synthetic signatures which shows the realism of the synthetic ones. The utility of the synthesized signatures is demonstrated by studying the influence of the pen type and number of users on an automatic signature verifier.",Biometric recognition; ink deposition model; kinematic theory of human movements; motor equivalence theory; off-line signature verification; synthetic generation
"Liu H., Latecki L.J., Yan S.",Dense subgraph partition of positive hypergraphs,2015,IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence,37,3,541,554,"In this paper, we present a novel partition framework, called dense subgraph partition (DSP), to automatically, precisely and efficiently decompose a positive hypergraph into dense subgraphs. A positive hypergraph is a graph or hypergraph whose edges, except self-loops, have positive weights. We first define the concepts of core subgraph, conditional core subgraph, and disjoint partition of a conditional core subgraph, then define DSP based on them. The result of DSP is an ordered list of dense subgraphs with decreasing densities, which uncovers all underlying clusters, as well as outliers. A divide-and-conquer algorithm, called min-partition evolution, is proposed to efficiently compute the partition. DSP has many appealing properties. First, it is a nonparametric partition and it reveals all meaningful clusters in a bottom-up way. Second, it has an exact and efficient solution, called min-partition evolution algorithm. The min-partition evolution algorithm is a divide-and-conquer algorithm, thus time-efficient and memory-friendly, and suitable for parallel processing. Third, it is a unified partition framework for a broad range of graphs and hypergraphs. We also establish its relationship with the densest k-subgraph problem (Dk S), an NP-hard but fundamental problem in graph theory, and prove that DSP gives precise solutions to Dk S for all k in a graph-dependent set, called critical k-set. To our best knowledge, this is a strong result which has not been reported before. Moreover, as our experimental results show, for sparse graphs, especially web graphs, the size of critical k -set is close to the number of vertices in the graph. We test the proposed partition framework on various tasks, and the experimental results clearly illustrate its advantages.",dense subgraph; densest k-subgraph; Graph partition; image matching; mode seeking

Such models are appropriate priors when exchangeability assumptions do not hold, and instead we want our model to vary fluidly with some set of covariates. Since the concept of dependent nonparametric processes was formalized by MacEachern, there have been a number of models proposed and used in the statistics and machine learning literatures.

"Xu Z., Yan F., Qi Y.",Bayesian nonparametric models for multiway data analysis,2015,IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence,37,2,475,487,"Tensor decomposition is a powerful computational tool for multiway data analysis. Many popular tensor decomposition approaches - such as the Tucker decomposition and CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) - amount to multi-linear factorization. They are insufficient to model (i) complex interactions between data entities, (ii) various data types (e.g., missing data and binary data), and (iii) noisy observations and outliers. To address these issues, we propose tensor-variate latent nonparametric Bayesian models for multiway data analysis. We name these models InfTucker. These new models essentially conduct Tucker decomposition in an infinite feature space. Unlike classical tensor decomposition models, our new approaches handle both continuous and binary data in a probabilistic framework. Unlike previous Bayesian models on matrices and tensors, our models are based on latent Gaussian or $t$ processes with nonlinear covariance functions. Moreover, on network data, our models reduce to nonparametric stochastic blockmodels and can be used to discover latent groups and predict missing interactions. To learn the models efficiently from data, we develop a variational inference technique and explore properties of the Kronecker product for computational efficiency. Compared with a classical variational implementation, this technique reduces both time and space complexities by several orders of magnitude.

We argue that these are the two features with which an analyst is typically most familiar, and hence that these are natural components with which to work. For the marginal distribution, we use a nonparametric Bayesian prior distribution along with a cdf-inverse cdf transformation to obtain large support. For the internal dynamics, we rely on the traditionally successful techniques of normal-theory time series. Coupling the two components gives us a family of (Gaussian) copula transformed autoregressive models. The models provide coherent adjustments of time scales and are compatible with many extensions, including changes in volatility of the series. We describe basic properties of the models, show their ability to recover non-Gaussian marginal distributions, and use a GARCH modification of the basic model to analyze stock index return series. The models are found to provide better fit and improved short-range and long-range predictions than Gaussian competitors. The models are extensible to a large variety of fields, including continuous time models, spatial models, models for multiple series, models driven by external covariate streams, and non-stationary models.",Autoregressive process; Copula model; GARCH; Probability integral transformation

The simplest possible models subdivide nodes of the network into clusters; the probability of a link between any two nodes then depends only on their cluster assignment. Currently available models can be classified by whether clusters are disjoint or are allowed to overlap. These models can explain a 'flat' clustering structure. Hierarchical Bayesian models provide a natural approach to capture more complex dependencies. We propose a model in which objects are characterised by a latent feature vector. Each feature is itself partitioned into disjoint groups (subclusters), corresponding to a second layer of hierarchy. In experimental comparisons, the model achieves significantly improved predictive performance on social and biological link prediction tasks.

For this we use hierarchical Bayesian nonparametric models. Moreover, we found it was important to properly model power-law phenomena in topic-word distributions and thus we used the full Pitman-Yor process rather than just a Dirichlet process. Furthermore, we propose the transformed Pitman-Yor process (TPYP) to incorporate prior knowledge such as vocabulary variations in different collections into the model. To deal with the non-conjugate issue between model prior and likelihood in the TPYP, we thus propose an efficient sampling algorithm using a data augmentation technique based on the multinomial theorem. Experimental results show the model discovers interesting aspects of different collections.

However, these GP advances have not been well extended to the multidimensional input setting, despite the preponderance of multidimensional applications. This paper introduces and tests three novel extensions of structured GPs to multidimensional inputs, for models with additive and multiplicative kernels. First we present a new method for inference in additive GPs, showing a novel connection between the classic backfitting method and the Bayesian framework. We extend this model using two advances: a variant of projection pursuit regression, and a Laplace approximation for non-Gaussian observations. Lastly, for multiplicative kernel structure, we present a novel method for GPs with inputs on a multidimensional grid. We illustrate the power of these three advances on several data sets, achieving performance equal to or very close to the naive GP at orders of magnitude less cost.",backfitting; Gaussian processes; Kronecker matrices; projection-pursuit regression

If we repeatedly sample from the ICDP we can generate sparse matrices with an infinite number of columns and power-law characteristics. We apply the four-parameter ICDP to sparse nonparametric topic modelling to account for the very large number of topics present in large text corpora and the power-law distribution of the vocabulary of natural languages. The model, which we call latent IBP compound Dirichlet allocation (LIDA), allows for power-law distributions, both, in the number of topics summarising the documents and in the number of words defining each topic. It can be interpreted as a sparse variant of the hierarchical Pitman-Yor process when applied to topic modelling. We derive an efficient and simple collapsed Gibbs sampler closely related to the collapsed Gibbs sampler of latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), making the model applicable in a wide range of domains.

However, autonomous reinforcement learning (RL) approaches typically require many interactions with the system to learn controllers, which is a practical limitation in real systems, such as robots, where many interactions can be impractical and time consuming. To address this problem, current learning approaches typically require task-specific knowledge in form of expert demonstrations, realistic simulators, pre-shaped policies, or specific knowledge about the underlying dynamics. In this paper, we follow a different approach and speed up learning by extracting more information from data. In particular, we learn a probabilistic, non-parametric Gaussian process transition model of the system. By explicitly incorporating model uncertainty into long-term planning and controller learning our approach reduces the effects of model errors, a key problem in model-based learning.

What makes these tasks hard is that often we do not have a natural representation with which to model the domain and use for choosing actions; we must learn about the domain's properties while simultaneously performing the task. Learning a representation also involves trade-offs between modeling the data that we have seen previously and being able to make predictions about new data. This article explores learning representations of stochastic systems using Bayesian nonparametric statistics. Bayesian nonparametric methods allow the sophistication of a representation to scale gracefully with the complexity in the data. Our main contribution is a careful empirical evaluation of how representations learned using Bayesian nonparametric methods compare to other standard learning approaches, especially in support of planning and control.

However, this popular strategy might be suboptimal as each label is supposed to possess specific characteristics of its own.

Most methods for visual recognition are fully supervised, as they make use of bounding boxes or pixelwise segmentations to locate objects of interest. However, this type of manual labeling is time consuming, error prone and it has been shown that manual segmentations are not necessarily the optimal spatial enclosure for object classifiers. This paper proposes a weakly-supervised system for multi-label image classification. In this setting, training images are annotated with a set of keywords describing their contents, but the visual concepts are not explicitly segmented in the images. We formulate the weakly-supervised image classification as a low-rank matrix completion problem.

We propose two alternative algorithms for matrix completion specifically tailored to visual data, and prove their convergence. (2) Unlike existing discriminative methods, our algorithm is robust to labeling errors, background noise and partial occlusions. (3) Our method can potentially be used for semantic segmentation.

However, it has been reported that, in some cases existing semi-supervised learning approaches perform even worse than supervised ones which only use labeled data. For this reason, it is desirable to develop safe semi-supervised learning approaches that will not significantly reduce learning performance when unlabeled data are used. This paper focuses on improving the safeness of semi-supervised support vector machines (S3VMs). First, the S3VM-us approach is proposed. It employs a conservative strategy and uses only the unlabeled instances that are very likely to be helpful, while avoiding the use of highly risky ones. This approach improves safeness but its performance improvement using unlabeled data is often much smaller than S3VMs. In order to develop a safe and well-performing approach, we examine the fundamental assumption of S3VMs, i.e., low-density separation. Based on the observation that multiple good candidate low-density separators may be identified from training data, safe semi-supervised support vector machines (S4VMs) are here proposed. This approach uses multiple low-density separators to approximate the ground-truth decision boundary and maximizes the improvement in performance of inductive SVMs for any candidate separator. Under the assumption employed by S3VMs, it is here shown that S4VMs are provably safe and that the performance improvement using unlabeled data can be maximized. An out-of-sample extension of S4VMs is also presented. This extension allows S4VMs to make predictions on unseen instances. Our empirical study on a broad range of data shows that the overall performance of S4VMs is highly competitive with S3VMs, whereas in contrast to S3VMs which hurt performance significantly in many cases, S4VMs rarely perform worse than inductive SVMs.",S3VMs; S4VMs; Safe; Semi-supervised learning; Unlabeled data

In the extreme, the two distributions could differ completely when the feature representation of the source domain is totally different from that of the target domain. To address the problems of substantial feature distribution divergence across domains and heterogeneous feature representations of different domains, we propose a novel feature space independent semi-supervised kernel matching method for domain adaptation in this work. Our approach learns a prediction function on the labeled source data while mapping the target data points to similar source data points by matching the target kernel matrix to a submatrix of the source kernel matrix based on a Hilbert Schmidt Independence Criterion.

In this paper, we introduce non-linear stationary subspace analysis: a method that overcomes this issue by explicitly separating the stationary parts of the video signal (i.e., the parts shared across all videos in one class), from its non-stationary parts (i.e., the parts specific to individual videos). Our method also encourages the new representation to be discriminative, thus accounting for the underlying classification problem. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on dynamic texture recognition, scene classification and action recognition.",kernel methods; stationarity; subspace analysis; Video classification

Automatic matching of latent fingerprints to rolled/plain (exemplar) fingerprints with high accuracy is quite vital for such applications. However, latent impressions are typically of poor quality with complex background noise which makes feature extraction and matching of latents a significantly challenging problem. We propose incorporating top-down information or feedback from an exemplar to refine the features extracted from a latent for improving latent matching accuracy. The refined latent features (e.g. ridge orientation and frequency), after feedback, are used to re-match the latent to the top K candidate exemplars returned by the baseline matcher and resort the candidate list. The contributions of this research include: (i) devising systemic ways to use information in exemplars for latent feature refinement, (ii) developing a feedback paradigm which can be wrapped around any latent matcher for improving its matching performance, and (iii) determining when feedback is actually necessary to improve latent matching accuracy. Experimental results show that integrating the proposed feedback paradigm with a state-of-the-art latent matcher improves its identification accuracy by 0.5-3.5 percent for NIST SD27 and WVU latent databases against a background database of 100k exemplars.",candidate list; exemplar feedback; feature refinement; Fingerprint; latent fingerprint matching

It has been shown that FLDA is asymptotically Bayes optimal under the homoscedastic Gaussian assumption. However, this classical result has the following two major limitations: 1) it holds only for a fixed dimensionality D , and thus does not apply when D and the training sample size N are proportionally large; 2) it does not provide a quantitative description on how the generalization ability of FLDA is affected by D and N. In this paper, we present an asymptotic generalization analysis of FLDA based on random matrix theory, in a setting where both D and N increase and D/N\ กๆ ฅใ ก๔ [0,1). The obtained lower bound of the generalization discrimination power overcomes both limitations of the classical result, i.e., it is applicable when D and N are proportionally large and provides a quantitative description of the generalization ability of FLDA in terms of the ratio ฅใ =D/N and the population discrimination power. Besides, the discrimination power bound also leads to an upper bound on the generalization error of binary-classification with FLDA.",asymptotic generalization analysis; Fishers linear discriminant analysis; random matrix theory

In this paper the problem of scenes with repeated structures is addressed, dealing with the common case where the overlap between the images consists mainly of facades of a building. These facades may contain many repeated structures that can not be matched locally, causing state-of-the-art algorithms to fail. Assuming that the repeated structures lie on a planar surface in an ordered fashion the goal is to match them. Our algorithm first rectifies the images such that the facade is fronto-parallel. It then clusters similar features in each of the two images and matches the clusters. From them a set of hypothesized homographies of the facade is generated, using local groups of features. For each homography the epipole is recovered, yielding a fundamental matrix. For the best solution, it then decides whether the fundamental matrix has been recovered reliably and, if not, returns only the homography.

Therefore, adapting the classifiers to the scenario in which they must operate is of paramount importance. We present novel domain adaptation (DA) methods for object detection. As proof of concept, we focus on adapting the state-of-the-art deformable part-based model (DPM) for pedestrian detection. We introduce an adaptive structural SVM (A-SSVM) that adapts a pre-learned classifier between different domains. By taking into account the inherent structure in feature space (e.g., the parts in a DPM), we propose a structure-aware A-SSVM (SA-SSVM). Neither A-SSVM nor SA-SSVM needs to revisit the source-domain training data to perform the adaptation. Rather, a low number of target-domain training examples (e.g., pedestrians) are used. To address the scenario where there are no target-domain annotated samples, we propose a self-adaptive DPM based on a self-paced learning (SPL) strategy and a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR). Two types of adaptation tasks are assessed: from both synthetic pedestrians and general persons (PASCAL VOC) to pedestrians imaged from an on-board camera.

The first algorithm utilizes a nonlinear similarity measure known as correntropy. The measure combines second and high order moments in its decision statistic showing improvements especially in the presence of impulsive noise. The algorithm assumes that the correspondence between the point sets is known, which is determined with the surprise metric. The second algorithm mitigates the need to establish a correspondence by representing the point sets as probability density functions (PDF). The registration problem is then treated as a distribution alignment. The method utilizes the Cauchy-Schwarz divergence to measure the similarity/distance between the point sets and recover the spatial transformation function needed to register them. Both algorithms utilize information theoretic descriptors; however, correntropy works at the realizations level, whereas Cauchy-Schwarz divergence works at the PDF level. This allows correntropy to be less computationally expensive, and for correct correspondence, more accurate. The two algorithms are robust against noise and outliers and perform well under varying levels of distortion.

Since LDSs live in anon-euclidean space and the descriptors are in non-vector form, we propose a shift invariant subspace angles based distance tomeasure the similarity between LDSs. In the local visual dimension, we construct curved spatio-temporal cuboids along the trajectories of densely sampled feature points and describe them using histograms of oriented gradients (HOG). The distance between motion sequences is computed with the Chi-Squared histogram distance in the bag-of-words framework. Finally we perform classification using the maximum margin distance learning method by combining the global dynamic distances and the local visual distances.

Existing examples include general tensor discriminant analysis (GTDA) and discriminant analysis with tensor representation (DATER). Both the two methods attempt to resolve the problem of tensor mode dependency by iterative approximation. GTDA is known to be the first MDA method that converges over iterations. However, its performance relies highly on the tuning of the parameter in the scatter difference criterion. Although DATER usually results in better classification performance, it does not converge, yet the number of iterations executed has a direct impact on DATER's performance. In this paper, we propose a closed-form solution to the scatter difference objective in GTDA, namely, direct GTDA (DGTDA) which also gets rid of parameter tuning. We demonstrate that DGTDA outperforms GTDA in terms of both efficiency and accuracy. In addition, we propose constrained multilinear discriminant analysis (CMDA) that learns the optimal tensor subspace by iteratively maximizing the scatter ratio criterion. We prove both theoretically and experimentally that the value of the scatter ratio criterion in CMDA approaches its extreme value, if it exists, with bounded error, leading to superior and more stable performance in comparison to DATER.","constrained multilinear discriminant analysis (CMDA); direct general tensor discriminant analysis (DGTDA); Linear discriminant analysis (LDA); multilinear discriminant analysis (MDA); pattern classification, higher-order tensor"

The criteria we wish to optimize are: (i) that the memory footprint of the representation should be very small (so that it fits into main memory); and (ii) that the approximation of the original vectors should be accurate. We introduce a novel encoding method, named a Set Compression Tree (SCT), that satisfies these criteria. It is able to accurately compress 1 million descriptors using only a few bits per descriptor. The large compression rate is achieved by not compressing on a per-descriptor basis, but instead by compressing the set of descriptors jointly. We describe the encoding, decoding and use for nearest neighbor search, all of which are quite straightforward to implement. The method, tested on standard benchmarks (SIFT1M and 80 Million Tiny Images), achieves superior performance to a number of state-of-the-art approaches, including Product Quantization, Locality Sensitive Hashing, Spectral Hashing, and Iterative Quantization. For example, SCT has a lower error using 5 bits than any of the other approaches, even when they use 16 or more bits per descriptor.

We call the family of transformation models the affine-functionfamily, in which all transformations can be expressed by affine functions with convex constraints. In this framework, the goal is to recover transformation parameters for every feature point in a template point set to calculate their optimal matching positions in an input image. Given pairwise feature dissimilarity values between all points in the template set and the input image, we create a convexdissimilarity function for each template point. Composition of such convex functions with any transformation model in the affine-function family is shown to have an equivalent convex optimization form that can be optimized efficiently. Four example transformation models in the affine-function family are introduced to show the flexibility of our proposed framework.

One way to approach this problem is through domain adaptation, and in this paper we primarily focus on the unsupervised scenario where the labeled source domain training data is accompanied by unlabeled target domain test data. We present a two-stage data-driven approach by generating intermediate data representations that could provide relevant information on the domain shift. Starting with a linear representation of domains in the form of generative subspaces of same dimensions for the source and target domains, we first utilize the underlying geometry of the space of these subspaces, the Grassmann manifold, to obtain a 'shortest' geodesic path between the two domains. We then sample points along the geodesic to obtain intermediate cross-domain data representations, using which a discriminative classifier is learnt to estimate the labels of the target data. We subsequently incorporate non-linear representation of domains by considering a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space representation, and a low-dimensional manifold representation using Laplacian Eigenmaps, and also examine other domain adaptation settings such as (i) semi-supervised adaptation where the target domain is partially labeled, and (ii) multi-domain adaptation where there could be more than one domain in source and/or target data sets. Finally, we supplement our adaptation technique with (i) fine-grained reference domains that are created by blending samples from source and target data sets to provide some evidence on the actual domain shift, and (ii) a multi-class boosting analysis to obtain robustness to the choice of algorithm parameters. We evaluate our approach for object recognition problems and report competitive results on two widely used Office and Bing adaptation data sets.",Domain adaptation; Grassmann manifold; Object recognition; Unsupervised

Articulated body pose estimation is challenging due to the large variation in body poses and appearances of the different body parts. Recent methods that rely on the pictorial structure framework have shown to be very successful in solving this task. They model the body part appearances using discriminatively trained, independent part templates and the spatial relations of the body parts using a tree model. Within such a framework, we address the problem of obtaining better part templates which are able to handle a very high variation in appearance. To this end, we introduce parts dependent body joint regressors which are random forests that operate over two layers. While the first layer acts as an independent body part classifier, the second layer takes the estimated class distributions of the first one into account and is thereby able to predict joint locations by modeling the interdependence and co-occurrence of the parts. This helps to overcome typical ambiguities of tree structures, such as self-similarities of legs and arms. In addition, we introduce a novel data set termed FashionPose that contains over 7,000 images with a challenging variation of body part appearances due to a large variation of dressing styles.

Examples include shape-dissimilarities, graph distances and mesh geodesic distances. In this paper, we provide a means of embedding such non-euclidean data onto surfaces of constant curvature. We aim to embed the data on a space whose radius of curvature is determined by the dissimilarity data. The space can be either of positive curvature (spherical) or of negative curvature (hyperbolic). We give an efficient method for solving the spherical and hyperbolic embedding problems on symmetric dissimilarity data. Our approach gives the radius of curvature and a method for approximating the objects as points on a hyperspherical manifold without optimisation. For objects which do not reside exactly on the manifold, we develop a optimisation-based procedure for approximate embedding on a hyperspherical manifold. We use the exponential map between the manifold and its local tangent space to solve the optimisation problem locally in the euclidean tangent space.

By capturing spatial and temporal structure in this unified fashion, both sources of information combine to yield disparity estimates that are naturally temporal coherent, while helping to resolve matches that might be ambiguous when either source is considered alone. Further, by allowing subsets of the orientation measurements to support different disparity estimates, an approach to recovering multilayer disparity from spacetime stereo is realized. Similarly, the matched distributions allow for direct recovery of dense, robust estimates of 3D scene flow. The approach has been implemented with real-time performance on commodity GPUs using OpenCL.

However, it is usually difficult to achieve a great tradeoff between discriminative power and robustness. Previous works shown that spatial co-occurrence can boost the discriminative power of features. However the current existing co-occurrence features are taking few considerations to the robustness and hence suffering from sensitivity to geometric and photometric variations. In this work, we study the Transform Invariance (TI) of co-occurrence features. Concretely we formally introduce a Pairwise Transform Invariance (PTI) principle, and then propose a novel Pairwise Rotation Invariant Co-occurrence Local Binary Pattern (PRICoLBP) feature, and further extend it to incorporate multi-scale, multi-orientation, and multi-channel information. Different from other LBP variants, PRICoLBP can not only capture the spatial context co-occurrence information effectively, but also possess rotation invariance. We evaluate PRICoLBP comprehensively on nine benchmark data sets from five different perspectives, e.g., encoding strategy, rotation invariance, the number of templates, speed, and discriminative power compared to other LBP variants. Furthermore we apply PRICoLBP to six different but related applications - texture, material, flower, leaf, food, and scene classification, and demonstrate that PRICoLBP is efficient, effective, and of a well-balanced tradeoff between the discriminative power and robustness.",Co-occurrence LBPs; flower recognition; food recognition; leaf recognition; material recognition; rotation invariance; scene recognition; texture classification

This situation has hardly been studied in computer vision research, even though it occurs frequently; the world contains tens of thousands of different object classes, and image collections have been formed and suitably annotated for only a few of them. To tackle the problem, we introduce attribute-based classification: Objects are identified based on a high-level description that is phrased in terms of semantic attributes, such as the object's color or shape. Because the identification of each such property transcends the specific learning task at hand, the attribute classifiers can be prelearned independently, for example, from existing image data sets unrelated to the current task. Afterward, new classes can be detected based on their attribute representation, without the need for a new training phase. In this paper, we also introduce a new data set, Animals with Attributes, of over 30,000 images of 50 animal classes, annotated with 85 semantic attributes. Extensive experiments on this and two more data sets show that attribute-based classification indeed is able to categorize images without access to any training images of the target classes. ? 2014 IEEE.",Object recognition; vision and scene understanding

Tensor completion, which is a high-order extension of matrix completion, has also generated a great deal of research interest in recent years. Given a tensor with incomplete entries, existing methods use either factorization or completion schemes to recover the missing parts. However, as the number of missing entries increases, factorization schemes may overfit the model because of incorrectly predefined ranks, while completion schemes may fail to interpret the model factors. In this paper, we introduce a novel concept: complete the missing entries and simultaneously capture the underlying model structure. To this end, we propose a method called simultaneous tensor decomposition and completion (STDC) that combines a rank minimization technique with Tucker model decomposition. Moreover, as the model structure is implicitly included in the Tucker model, we use factor priors, which are usually known a priori in real-world tensor objects, to characterize the underlying joint-manifold drawn from the model factors. By exploiting this auxiliary information, our method leverages two classic schemes and accurately estimates the model factors and missing entries. We conducted experiments to empirically verify the convergence of our algorithm on synthetic data and evaluate its effectiveness on various kinds of real-world data. The results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method and its potential usage in tensor-based applications. It also outperforms state-of-the-art methods on multilinear model analysis and visual data completion tasks. ? 2014 IEEE.",factor priors; multilinear model analysis; Tensor completion; Tucker decomposition
"Huang Y., Wu Z., Wang L., Tan T.",Feature coding in image classification: A comprehensive study,2014,IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence,36,3,493,506,"Image classification is a hot topic in computer vision and pattern recognition. Feature coding, as a key component of image classification, has been widely studied over the past several years, and a number of coding algorithms have been proposed. However, there is no comprehensive study concerning the connections between different coding methods, especially how they have evolved. In this paper, we first make a survey on various feature coding methods, including their motivations and mathematical representations, and then exploit their relations, based on which a taxonomy is proposed to reveal their evolution. Further, we summarize the main characteristics of current algorithms, each of which is shared by several coding strategies. Finally, we choose several representatives from different kinds of coding approaches and empirically evaluate them with respect to the size of the codebook and the number of training samples on several widely used databases (15-Scenes, Caltech-256, PASCAL VOC07, and SUN397).

Such a visual codebook has to be discriminative enough to achieve excellent recognition performance. To create a compact and discriminative codebook, in this paper we propose to merge the visual words in a large-sized initial codebook by maximally preserving class separability. We first show that this results in a difficult optimization problem. To deal with this situation, we devise a suboptimal but very efficient hierarchical word-merging algorithm, which optimally merges two words at each level of the hierarchy. By exploiting the characteristics of the class separability measure and designing a novel indexing structure, the proposed algorithm can hierarchically merge 10,000 visual words down to two words in merely 90 seconds. Also, to show the properties of the proposed algorithm and reveal its advantages, we conduct detailed theoretical analysis to compare it with another hierarchical word-merging algorithm that maximally preserves mutual information, obtaining interesting findings. Experimental studies are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm on multiple benchmark data sets. As shown, it can efficiently produce more compact and discriminative codebooks than the state-of-the-art hierarchical word-merging algorithms, especially when the size of the codebook is significantly reduced. ? 2014 IEEE.",bag-of-features model; class separability; compact codebook; Hierarchical word merge; object recognition
"Yao B.Z., Nie B.X., Liu Z., Zhu S.-C.",Animated pose templates for modeling and detecting human actions,2014,IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence,36,3,436,452,"This paper presents animated pose templates (APTs) for detecting short-term, long-term, and contextual actions from cluttered scenes in videos. Each pose template consists of two components: 1) a shape template with deformable parts represented in an And-node whose appearances are represented by the Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG) features, and 2) a motion template specifying the motion of the parts by the Histogram of Optical-Flows (HOF) features. A shape template may have more than one motion template represented by an Or-node. Therefore, each action is defined as a mixture (Or-node) of pose templates in an And-Or tree structure. While this pose template is suitable for detecting short-term action snippets in two to five frames, we extend it in two ways: 1) For long-term actions, we animate the pose templates by adding temporal constraints in a Hidden Markov Model (HMM), and 2) for contextual actions, we treat contextual objects as additional parts of the pose templates and add constraints that encode spatial correlations between parts. To train the model, we manually annotate part locations on several keyframes of each video and cluster them into pose templates using EM. This leaves the unknown parameters for our learning algorithm in two groups: 1) latent variables for the unannotated frames including pose-IDs and part locations, 2) model parameters shared by all training samples such as weights for HOG and HOF features, canonical part locations of each pose, coefficients penalizing pose-transition and part-deformation. To learn these parameters, we introduce a semi-supervised structural SVM algorithm that iterates between two steps: 1) learning (updating) model parameters using labeled data by solving a structural SVM optimization, and 2) imputing missing variables (i.e., detecting actions on unlabeled frames) with parameters learned from the previous step and progressively accepting high-score frames as newly labeled examples. This algorithm belongs to a family of optimization methods known as the Concave-Convex Procedure (CCCP) that converge to a local optimal solution. The inference algorithm consists of two components: 1) Detecting top candidates for the pose templates, and 2) computing the sequence of pose templates. Both are done by dynamic programming or, more precisely, beam search. In experiments, we demonstrate that this method is capable of discovering salient poses of actions as well as interactions with contextual objects. We test our method on several public action data sets and a challenging outdoor contextual action data set collected by ourselves. The results show that our model achieves comparable or better performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. ? 2014 IEEE.",Action detection; action recognition; animated pose templates; structural SVM
"Xia H., Hoi S.C.H., Jin R., Zhao P.",Online multiple kernel similarity learning for visual search,2014,IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence,36,3,536,549,"Recent years have witnessed a number of studies on distance metric learning to improve visual similarity search in content-based image retrieval (CBIR). Despite their successes, most existing methods on distance metric learning are limited in two aspects. First, they usually assume the target proximity function follows the family of Mahalanobis distances, which limits their capacity of measuring similarity of complex patterns in real applications. Second, they often cannot effectively handle the similarity measure of multimodal data that may originate from multiple resources. To overcome these limitations, this paper investigates an online kernel similarity learning framework for learning kernel-based proximity functions which goes beyond the conventional linear distance metric learning approaches. Based on the framework, we propose a novel online multiple kernel similarity (OMKS) learning method which learns a flexible nonlinear proximity function with multiple kernels to improve visual similarity search in CBIR. We evaluate the proposed technique for CBIR on a variety of image data sets in which encouraging results show that OMKS outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques significantly. ? 2014 IEEE.",content-based image retrieval; kernel methods; multiple kernel learning; online learning; Similarity search

The approach operates orders of magnitude faster than alternative techniques and is well suited to further performance gains through parallelized implementation. The algorithm employs multiple hypotheses to deal with motion ambiguities, rather than the traditional smoothness constraints, removing oversmoothing errors and providing significant performance improvements on benchmark data, over the previous state of the art. The approach is flexible and capable of operating with any combination of appearance and/or depth sensors, in any setup, simultaneously estimating the structure and motion if necessary. Additionally, the algorithm propagates information over time to resolve ambiguities, rather than performing an isolated estimation at each frame, as in contemporary approaches. Approaches to smoothing the motion field without sacrificing the benefits of multiple hypotheses are explored, and a probabilistic approach to occlusion estimation is demonstrated, leading to 10 and 15 percent improved performance, respectively. Finally, a data-driven tracking approach is described, and used to estimate the 3D trajectories of hands during sign language, without the need to model complex appearance variations at each viewpoint. ? 2014 IEEE.",3D; 3D motion; 3D tracking; bilateral filter; hand tracking; motion estimation; motion segmentation; occlusion; occlusion estimation; optical flow; particle; particle filter; probabilistic occlusion; Scene flow; scene particles; sign language; tracking

Disparity maps are estimated locally using epipolar plane image analysis without the need for expensive matching cost minimization. The method works fast and with inherent subpixel accuracy since no discretization of the disparity space is necessary. In a variational framework, we employ the disparity maps to generate super-resolved novel views of a scene, which corresponds to increasing the sampling rate of the 4D light field in spatial as well as angular direction. In contrast to previous work, we formulate the problem of view synthesis as a continuous inverse problem, which allows us to correctly take into account foreshortening effects caused by scene geometry transformations. All optimization problems are solved with state-of-the-art convex relaxation techniques. We test our algorithms on a number of real-world examples as well as our new benchmark data set for light fields, and compare results to a multiview stereo method.

We consider one-versus-rest, multiclass, ranking, and weighted approximate ranking SVMs. A comparison of online and batch methods for optimizing the objectives shows that online methods perform as well as batch methods in terms of classification accuracy, but with a significant gain in training speed. Using stochastic gradient descent, we can scale the training to millions of images and thousands of classes. Our experimental evaluation shows that ranking-based algorithms do not outperform the one-versus-rest strategy when a large number of training examples are used. Furthermore, the gap in accuracy between the different algorithms shrinks as the dimension of the features increases. We also show that learning through cross-validation the optimal rebalancing of positive and negative examples can result in a significant improvement for the one-versus-rest strategy.

In the matrix case, the data points are merely vectorized and treated as vectors thereafter (for example, image patches). However, this approach cannot be used for all matrices, as it may destroy the inherent structure of the data. Symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrices constitute one such class of signals, where their implicit structure of positive eigenvalues is lost upon vectorization. This paper proposes a novel sparse coding technique for positive definite matrices, which respects the structure of the Riemannian manifold and preserves the positivity of their eigenvalues, without resorting to vectorization. Synthetic and real-world computer vision experiments with region covariance descriptors demonstrate the need for and the applicability of the new sparse coding model.

This problem addresses the design of retrieval systems that support queries across content modalities, for example, using an image to search for texts. A mathematical formulation is proposed, equating the design of cross-modal retrieval systems to that of isomorphic feature spaces for different content modalities. Two hypotheses are then investigated regarding the fundamental attributes of these spaces. The first is that low-level cross-modal correlations should be accounted for. The second is that the space should enable semantic abstraction. Three new solutions to the cross-modal retrieval problem are then derived from these hypotheses: correlation matching (CM), an unsupervised method which models cross-modal correlations, semantic matching (SM), a supervised technique that relies on semantic representation, and semantic correlation matching (SCM), which combines both. An extensive evaluation of retrieval performance is conducted to test the validity of the hypotheses. All approaches are shown successful for text retrieval in response to image queries and vice versa. It is concluded that both hypotheses hold, in a complementary form, although evidence in favor of the abstraction hypothesis is stronger than that for correlation. ? 2014 IEEE.",content-based retrieval; cross-modal; image and text; kernel correlation; logistic regression; Multimedia; multimodal; retrieval model; semantic spaces

In this work, we address this problem by investigating a retrieval-based annotation scheme of mining massive web facial images that are freely available over the Internet. In particular, given a facial image, we first retrieve the top n similar instances from a large-scale web facial image database using content-based image retrieval techniques, and then use their labels for auto annotation. Such a scheme has two major challenges: 1) how to retrieve the similar facial images that truly match the query, and 2) how to exploit the noisy labels of the top similar facial images, which may be incorrect or incomplete due to the nature of web images. In this paper, we propose an effective Weak Label Regularized Local Coordinate Coding (WLRLCC) technique, which exploits the principle of local coordinate coding by learning sparse features, and employs the idea of graph-based weak label regularization to enhance the weak labels of the similar facial images. An efficient optimization algorithm is proposed to solve the WLRLCC problem. Moreover, an effective sparse reconstruction scheme is developed to perform the face annotation task. We conduct extensive empirical studies on several web facial image databases to evaluate the proposed WLRLCC algorithm from different aspects. The experimental results validate its efficacy.

The algorithm takes as input a pair of surfaces that are topological 2-spheres, each surface given by a distinct triangulation. The algorithm then constructs a map f between the two surfaces. First, each of the two triangular meshes is mapped to the unit sphere using a discrete conformal mapping algorithm. The two mappings are then composed with a M?bius transformation to generate the function f. The M?bius transformation is chosen by minimizing an energy that measures the distance of f from an isometry. We illustrate our approach using several 'real life' data sets. We show first that the algorithm allows for accurate, automatic, and landmark-free nonrigid registration of brain surfaces. We then validate our approach by comparing shapes of proteins. We provide numerical experiments to demonstrate that the distances computed with our algorithm between low-resolution, surface-based representations of proteins are highly correlated with the corresponding distances computed between high-resolution, atomistic models for the same proteins. ? 2014 IEEE.",Conformal mapping; mesh warping; M?bius transformation; nonrigid registration

We compute the principal eigenvector of the approximated affinity tensor using the small bases and index tensors without explicitly storing the approximated tensor.

Although several robust sparse models have been proposed and promising results have been obtained, they are either for error correction or for error detection, and learning a general framework that systematically unifies these two aspects and explores their relation is still an open problem. In this paper, we develop a half-quadratic (HQ) framework to solve the robust sparse representation problem. By defining different kinds of half-quadratic functions, the proposed HQ framework is applicable to performing both error correction and error detection. More specifically, by using the additive form of HQ, we propose an (\ell-1)-regularized error correction method by iteratively recovering corrupted data from errors incurred by noises and outliers; by using the multiplicative form of HQ, we propose an (\ell-1)-regularized error detection method by learning from uncorrupted data iteratively.

In this paper, we propose a Bayesian approach to adaptive video super resolution via simultaneously estimating underlying motion, blur kernel, and noise level while reconstructing the original high-resolution frames. As a result, our system not only produces very promising super resolution results outperforming the state of the art, but also adapts to a variety of noise levels and blur kernels. To further analyze the effect of noise and blur kernel, we perform a two-step analysis using the Cramer-Rao bounds.
